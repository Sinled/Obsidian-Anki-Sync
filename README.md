# Obsidian Anki Sync - Yet another anki plugin

This plugin allow you to make flashcards in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and sync them to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

This is similar to [Obsidian_to_Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki) except this plugin uses a different and more powerful markup based syntax for making flashcards.

**NB: Please do not use this in your main vault or main anki account until 0.5.0 is released  (by 15-06-21).**

## Installation

1. Download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from [releases](https://github.com/debanjandhar12/Obsidian-Anki-Sync/releases) and put it in a new folder in your obsidian plugin folder.

2. Install AnkiConnect on Anki

   - Open Anki

   - Select `Tools` > `Add-ons `. Now a Anki addon's dialog will open. 

   - Now click `Get Add-ons...` in addon's dialog and enter [2055492159](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) into the text box labeled `Code` and press the `OK` button to proceed.

   - Select `Tools` > `Add-ons ` to re-open addon's dialog. Select Anki-Connect plugin and click `Config`. Now enter the configuration bellow and click ok.

     ```json
     {
         "apiKey": null,
         "apiLogPath": null,
         "webBindAddress": "127.0.0.1",
         "webBindPort": 8765,
         "webCorsOrigin": "http://localhost",
         "webCorsOriginList": [

             "app://obsidian.md"
         ]
     }
     ```

     

   - Restart Anki

3. Now, you can use the plugin by clicking Sync to Anki button.

## FAQ
<details>
 <summary>Why yet another plugin for obsidian to anki sync?</summary>
The exsisting two plugins have a major limitation to implement my workflow: No clozes inside math and code blocks â˜¹ <br>
It was absolutely necessary for me. This is why why I started this as a personal project.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Can i delete or modify the auto-generated oid attribute?
 </summary>
<b>No!</b> Please dont do that. <br> We use that oid to track the cards in anki.
Deleting it will cause the plugin to delete the old card and create a new one in Anki. This means that the scheduling information for the card gets deleted if you remove or modify oid.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Where is the auto anki backup taken before every sync stored?</summary>
In Windows 10, it is stored at:<br>
C:\Users\{WindowsUserName}\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\{AnkiProfileName}\backup
<br><br>
NB: It is stored in a per-deck basis with name ObsidianAnkiSync-Backup-${timestamp}_${deck}.apkg
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Do the auto anki backup also store scheduling information?</summary>
 Yes.
